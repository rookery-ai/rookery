# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Build
go build -o bin/simple-agents ./cmd/simple-agents

# Run all tests
go test ./... -count=1 -timeout 120s

# Run a specific package's tests
go test -v ./internal/agentdesigner/... -run TestFlow

# Run the server (after build)
./bin/simple-agents serve

# Bootstrap admin user (first run only)
./bin/simple-agents admin bootstrap

# Database migration
./bin/simple-agents db migrate
```

AST guardrail tests shell out to `python3`. If Python is not available, those tests self-skip.

## Architecture

### Entry point & wiring

`cmd/simple-agents/main.go` loads `config.yaml` via `internal/config`, wires all services, and
delegates subcommands via `github.com/urfave/cli/v3`. The `serve` subcommand:
1. Opens/migrates SQLite DB
2. Creates secrets service, coder, agent designer, agent runner
3. Starts `GatewayManager` (loads all `platform_connections` from DB, starts per-user adapters)
4. Starts scheduler and reminder background goroutines
5. Starts Echo web server

### Inbound message pipeline

```
Telegram adapter (per-user bot instance)
  → GatewayManager.route()
    → IdentityResolver  (platform_user_id → internal user_id via platform_identities table)
    → Router.Handle()
      → /agent  → agentdesigner.Flow (conversational FSM)
      → /run    → agentrunner.Runner
      → /secret → SecretStore
      → /remind → reminder.Service
      → /chat → db.Chat (start/list/stop/resume/delete)
      → /memory → memory.Store (add/list/delete bullets in GENERAL.md)
      → plain text → one-off chat (coder.Coder with read+write KB tools; see "Chat knowledge-base access")
```

### Key packages

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `internal/config` | YAML config + env overrides |
| `internal/db` | SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`; `DB`, models, per-table query helpers |
| `internal/auth` | CreateUser, Authenticate, ChangePassword, GenerateTempPassword, bcrypt |
| `internal/rbac` | `CanPerform(db, userID, permission)` — reads `user_permissions` table |
| `internal/secrets` | AES-256-GCM store; Argon2id key derivation; `GetAll()` decrypts all for env injection; `Proxy()` resolves `${NAME}` in-memory only |
| `internal/gateway` | `Gateway` interface, `GatewayManager`, `Router`, `IdentityResolver`, `TelegramGateway` |
| `internal/coder` | `Coder`: runs coder CLI subprocess with full per-user isolation; `CoderBackend` interface abstracts Claude vs. generic CLIs; `WithNoTools()` for text-only calls; `WithExtraEnv()` for secret injection |
| `internal/agentdesigner` | `Flow` FSM (Describing→Designing→Verifying→Done); conversational design shared between web and Telegram; auto-schedule; `RunFullGuardrails`/`RunToolGuardrails` (ethics + AST only); `toolstree.go` recursive path-safe `WriteToolsTree`/`ReadToolsTree` for multi-file projects |
| `internal/agentrunner` | Load agent → decrypt secrets into env via `WithExtraEnv` → coder subprocess → capture `[CHAT]` lines → send via GatewayManager; timestamped run logs; `RunInput.OnProgress` per-turn hook for live SSE streaming. **Reliable delivery**: `parseCoderOutput` (blank lines don't end `[CHAT]`; empty `[CHAT]` dropped; `[SILENT]` detected) + `extractProseMessage` fallback when no `[CHAT]` emitted and not silent → visible warning when nothing deliverable. Covered by `runner_test.go`. |
| `internal/sandbox` | Self-contained Landlock filesystem confinement for coder subprocesses (Linux). `Spec`, `Supported()`, `Wrap()` (re-exec via the hidden `__sandbox-exec` helper), `Exec()` (applies Landlock + rlimits, then `execve`). No external dependency. |
| `internal/scheduler` | Cron scheduler: polls `agent_schedules`, fires runner, decrypts stored master password for secret injection; `WithSender()` delivers output to users |
| `internal/reminder` | Creates/lists/fires reminders; background polling goroutine. Reminders live only in the DB and the reminders UI tab — they are NOT reflected to the vault. |
| `internal/chat` | `Chat` create/list/stop/resume/delete; 30-min idle auto-stop; `BuildUserContext` (shared **identity-only** context builder for one-off chat — profile/memory/agents/MCP; the broader KB is retrieved on demand via tools, not injected here) |
| `internal/prompts` | Central home for all LLM prompt construction: `BuildDesignSystemPrompt` (+ `<knowledge_base>` block + `KBManifest`), `BuildImplementationPrompt`, `BuildEditImplementationPrompt` (diagnose-before-fix), `BuildCoderPrompt`, `BuildChatSystemPrompt` (chat read+write KB instruction), `BuildChildAgentFollowUpPrompt`, `BuildSkillMetaPrompt`, `BuildReminderParsePrompt`. No inline prompt text exists outside this package. Shared single-source blocks: `agentPhilosophyBlock` (three-tier), `platformContextBlock`, `coderCapabilitiesBlock` (backend-aware), `agentArchitectureGateBlock`, `testingRulesBlock`, `shellSafetyBlock`, `scriptRobustnessBlock`, `composioServicesBlock`. `ChatAppsForPlatforms` + `MapCoderBackend` bridge callers to prompt params. |
| `internal/memory` | Per-user structured context store. Memory lives as named `.md` files in `memory/` (`USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `GENERAL.md`, etc.) — editable via the KB browser. `ContextString()` reads all files, skips placeholder-only ones, and returns sectioned markdown for LLM injection. `Append/List/Delete` target GENERAL.md bullet lines (used by Telegram `/memory` command). `MigrateToStructuredFiles()` consolidates legacy UUID-keyed entries at startup. |
| `internal/vault` | Per-user Obsidian-style knowledge base: `Vault` (paths + `Resolve` safety + file IO), `Reflector` (chats→markdown+sidecar), `LinkIndex` ([[wikilinks]]), `Searcher` (ripgrep), `Guard` (post-run write-scope enforcement), `MigrateLegacyLayout`, `MigrateSessionsToChats`. |
| `internal/audit` | Structured audit event writer → `audit_logs` table |
| `internal/profile` | Per-user personalization (name, email, location, timezone, tone, language, notes); stored in the generic `settings` table; `Load()`/`Save()`/`ContextString()` for LLM injection; `LoadLocation()` for timezone-aware reminder parsing |
| `internal/skillstore` | `SkillStore`: install/load/delete SKILL.md based skills per user |
| `web/` | Echo v4 web server; full user dashboard + admin UI |

### Per-user knowledge base (vault)

Every user has one Obsidian-style vault — a single directory of interlinked markdown notes.
`internal/vault` owns all vault path/IO/safety logic. The SQLite DB remains the system-of-record;
chats are *reflected* into the vault as markdown + JSON sidecars.

```

`claude-homes/<userID>/` stays OUTSIDE the vault (holds `.claude` credentials — never backed up).

**Memory injection.** All `.md` files in `memory/` are automatically injected into every LLM
context (design sessions, agent runs, one-off chat) via `memory.ContextString()`. Files whose
body is only headings and HTML placeholder comments are silently skipped until the user fills
them in. `EnsureScaffold` creates `USER.md` and `SOUL.md` with placeholder content on first visit.

Key types in `internal/vault`:
- **`Vault`** — `Root/AgentsDir/AgentDir/MemoryDir/SkillsDir`; **`Resolve(userID, rel)`** is the security primitive every read/write path uses (rejects `..`/absolute escapes); `WriteNote` (atomic), `Read/Delete/Rename/List/EnsureScaffold`. `List` hides dotfiles.
- **`Reflector`** — `ReflectChat/ReflectAgentRun`: markdown note + `.kb/db-export/<table>/<id>.json` sidecar. Reminders are NOT reflected.
- **`LinkIndex`** — `[[wikilink]]` parsing/resolution + `RenderHTMLLinks`; `Backlinks`.
- **`Searcher`** — `ripgrepSearcher` (rg `--json`, pure-Go fallback).
- **`Guard`** — detective post-run write-scope enforcement (snapshot/revert). No longer wired into agent runs (the policy changed to let agents edit the KB directly — see "Agent access model"); the type + tests remain as a reusable utility.
- **`MigrateLegacyLayout()`** — idempotent startup migration of pre-vault `agents/`, `memory/` (jsonl→md), `skills/` into vaults.

**Agent access model.** An agent's run CWD is its own vault dir; the coder prompt (`BuildCoderPrompt`, `<knowledge_base>` block) tells it to READ the whole vault and WRITE to both its own dir and the user's knowledge base (notes, memory, user files) — durable knowledge is persisted into the KB across runs. The Landlock sandbox grants RW over the whole vault root (confined to that user's vault + HOME; the DB, config, and other users' vaults stay out of reach). System-managed dirs (`.kb/`, `chats/`, other agents' `agents/<id>/`) are off-limits by prompt, not hard-enforced. The chat uses the same model (see `prompts.BuildChatSystemPrompt`).

**Chat knowledge-base access (on-demand retrieval + editing).** The one-off chat coder runs with `WithDir(vaultRoot).WithAllowedTools("Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep")` and a system instruction (`prompts.BuildChatSystemPrompt`) naming the vault root. The LLM retrieves and edits the user's notes **on demand** — only on turns that touch the KB — instead of having the vault injected every prompt. `chat.BuildUserContext` now returns identity-only context (profile/memory/agents/MCP); the old always-on `[Related knowledge base]` keyword-snippet block was removed. The tool set is file-only (no `Bash`/`WebFetch`): the chat can create/edit/read notes but cannot delete, rename, or run shell commands. The same applies to agents (RW over the vault via the sandbox). The detective `Guard` is no longer wired into agent runs — it would revert the KB edits that are now intentional — so agent/chat KB edits persist.

**Agent designer KB awareness.** The designer is text-only (`WithNoTools`) but its system prompt (`BuildDesignSystemPrompt`, `<knowledge_base>` block) now knows the app has a built-in vault that agents read/write, and is told to prefer it over Notion/external note apps for the user's own knowledge. Each design turn injects a fresh manifest of the user's existing note paths via `Flow.WithKBLister` → `vault.NotePaths(userID)` → `DesignSystemParams.KBManifest`, so the designer can reference the user's actual notes.

### Unified conversational agent creation

Agent creation uses a single `agentdesigner.Flow` FSM shared between Telegram and web. No agent types — every agent is the same structure.

**FSM states:** `StateDescribing` (Telegram only) → `StateDesigning` → `StateVerifying` → `StateDone`

**Approval triggers** (exact match): `"approve"`, `"go ahead"`, `"build it"`, `"create it"`, `"/approve"`

**On approval:** `runGeneration()` calls the coder with full tools (`WithDir(agentDir).WithAllowedTools("Bash,Write,Edit,Read")`). Coder writes `AGENT.md` + `tools/*.py` to disk, runs scripts via Bash, fixes errors, outputs `[TEST_OUTPUT]...[/TEST_OUTPUT]`. Flow reads AGENT.md, runs guardrails, stores in `PendingAgentMD`/`PendingTools`, moves to `StateVerifying`. If `[TEST_OUTPUT]` is absent, user stays in `StateDesigning`.

**Generation failure handling:** `[BLOCKED]` marker, `ErrUsageLimit`, and timeout all return soft user-facing strings (not Go errors) — user stays in `StateDesigning`.

**SSE progress:** `DesignSession` carries `progressCh chan string` + `cancelGenerate`. `GetProgressChan(userID)` lets the web SSE handler stream milestone events to the browser.

**Auto-schedule:** If AGENT.md starts with `# Suggested schedule: */10 * * * *`, `parseSuggestedSchedule()` calls `db.UpsertAgentSchedule()` immediately.

### Prompt architecture (coder-agnostic, three-tier)

All prompts live in `internal/prompts` (single source). The designer produces **coder-agnostic** AGENT.md — it says WHAT to do, never runtime-specific tool names (so it works on a full coder like claude-code/codex OR a basic model call like OpenRouter GLM). HOW the coder acts on files is injected separately based on `BackendType`:

- **`platformContextBlock(chatApps, vaultRoot)`** — full Simple Agents primer (flexible ever-growing KB with USER-REORGANIZABLE vs SYSTEM-WRITTEN fixed locations, secrets store, chats, reminders, connected chat apps + commands, output protocol, schedule). Injected into design, implementation, and runtime prompts.
- **`coderCapabilitiesBlock(backendType)`** — `BackendFullCoder` → direct tool access; `BackendBasicModel` → `[READ_FILE]`/`[WRITE_FILE]`/`[RUN_SCRIPT]` output markers. `MapCoderBackend()` maps the coder's backend type to these.
- **`agentPhilosophyBlock()`** — three-tier taxonomy (TIER 1 reasoning-only / TIER 2 one script / TIER 3 multi-file) with NOT-TO-DO lists; forces the coder to pick the simplest tier that solves the task (prevents writing a script for trivial reasoning work).
- **`agentArchitectureGateBlock()`** — mandatory TASK ANALYSIS → TIER DECISION → NOTIFICATION DECISION → SCHEDULE DECISION before any file is created. Supports no-notification (`[SILENT]`) and no-schedule (`none`) agents.
- **`ChatAppsForPlatforms()`** — central platform→`ChatAppInfo` (name + commands) mapping; callers load via `db.ListUserPlatformConnections` (no GatewayManager method needed).
- Design UX is non-technical: a jargon blocklist (FORBIDDEN: AGENT.md, Python, script, vault, cron, JSON, shell, Bash, webhook, endpoint); asks notification preference + schedule; emits a `[TECHNICAL SPEC]` for the code generator.

### Composio integration

Composio connects agents to 250+ external services via the **v3 REST API** (not the deprecated SDK).

- `composioServicesBlock()` in `internal/prompts/prompts.go` is the **single source** of the v3 spec — injected into design, create, and edit prompts.
- Base: `https://backend.composio.dev/api/v3` · Auth: `x-api-key` header
- Connected accounts: `GET /connected_accounts?limit=100` · Execute: `POST /tools/execute/{TOOL_SLUG}`
- Guardrails block: SDK imports (`from composio import`), hardcoded keys (`ak_...`), wrong host (`api.composio.dev`), old versions (`/v1/`, `/v2/`).

### Conversational agent editing

Editing reuses the same `Flow` FSM via `DesignSession.IsEdit`. `loadAgentForEdit` reads live `AGENT.md` and reconciles its `# Suggested schedule:` line against the real `agent_schedules` row before the coder sees it.

**Diagnose-before-fix flow** (`BuildEditImplementationPrompt` + the edit variant of `BuildDesignSystemPrompt`): the designer must DIAGNOSE the root cause in plain English to the user → CONFIRM the proposed fix → AWAIT APPROVAL, then the editor states the root cause + fix in code, applies only the targeted change, and fully re-tests, proving the original bug no longer occurs. Prevents superficial edits that don't fix the actual problem.

**Edit generation** runs in a sibling staging dir (`<agentID>-edit-staging`) — the live agent dir is never touched before approval. On approval, `updateAndFinish()` calls `AgentDesigner.UpdateAgent` → `db.UpdateAgentDescription` (UPDATE, not INSERT). `reconcileScheduleOnSave()` reuses the existing schedule row's ID to avoid duplicate rows and double-firing.

### Agent output protocol (AGENT.md)

- **`[CHAT]`** — sends a message to the user. A `[CHAT]` block runs until the next protocol marker (`[STATE]`, `[CALL]`, `[SILENT]`, a new `[CHAT]`) or end of output; **blank lines are part of the message, not a terminator** (an earlier rule ended the block at a blank line and silently dropped real content — fixed). Empty/whitespace-only `[CHAT]` blocks are dropped (never deliver a blank message).
- **`[STATE]...[/STATE]`** — JSON merged into `state.json` (null = delete key). Inline and multi-line forms accepted.
- **`[CALL: <agent-name>]`** — invoke another agent synchronously (max depth 3, cycle detection).
- **`[SILENT]`** — emitted alone as the last line by note-only/state-only agents that intentionally produce no user-facing message. Suppresses the prose-delivery fallback (see "Reliable delivery" below).

### Reliable delivery

Delivery does **not** depend solely on the coder emitting `[CHAT]` — models (especially basic ones) sometimes forget the marker and write the message as plain prose, or emit only reasoning. The runner (`runCoderAgent`, `parseCoderOutput`, `extractProseMessage` in `internal/agentrunner/runner.go`) guarantees:

1. **Empty `[CHAT]` filtered** — a blank marker never delivers an empty message.
2. **Prose fallback** — if no `[CHAT]` was parsed and `[SILENT]` was NOT emitted, the coder's prose output (protocol markers stripped) is delivered as the message, with a `no [CHAT] marker emitted; delivered prose as fallback` warning recorded.
3. **`[SILENT]`** — when present, the prose fallback is suppressed so silent agents aren't noisified by stray prose.
4. **Visible failure** — if a run succeeds but produces nothing deliverable and didn't signal `[SILENT]`, the user receives `⚠️ <agent> ran but produced no notification — see the run log.` instead of a silent success.

Delivery reaches both paths: `SendOutput` (durable — web → `gateway.SendToUser`, scheduler → chat platform) and `OnProgress` (live SSE). Parser behavior is covered by `runner_test.go`.

### Secret injection

Secrets stored encrypted in `secrets` table. Three sources of `MasterPw` at runtime:
- **Scheduled runs** — `scheduler.go` decrypts stored `EncryptedMasterPassword` (encrypted with `systemKey`).
- **Manual runs** — `handleRunAgent()` does the same. No password field on the run form.
- **Agent generation** — `Flow.WithSecretsLoader()` decrypts and injects via `WithExtraEnv(secrets)` so agents can make real API calls during validation.

### Coder tool isolation

`internal/coder/coder.go` modifiers (all return a shallow copy):

- **`WithNoTools()`** — `--allowedTools ""`. Used for design conversation turns.
- **`WithAllowedTools(tools)`** — Required whenever `--setting-sources ""` is active or subprocess blocks on permission prompts. Generation: `"Bash,Write,Edit,Read"`; runs: `"Bash,WebFetch,Read,Write,Edit"`.
- **`WithDir(dir)`** — overrides subprocess CWD. Used by generation AND every agent run — without it the agent writes to the shared per-user home and contaminates other agents.
- **`WithExtraEnv(env)`** — merges additional env vars. System overrides always take precedence.
- **`WithBackendType(t)`** — forces `"claude"`, `"generic"`, or `""` (auto-detect by binary name).

**`CoderBackend`** (`internal/coder/backend.go`): `claudeBackend` (Claude CLI: `--output-format json`, `--setting-sources ""`) and `genericCLIBackend` (any other CLI, plain-text stdout).

**Critical:** `--setting-sources ""` + no `--allowedTools` = subprocess hangs indefinitely.

### Usage-limit detection

`coder.ErrUsageLimit` — non-zero exit with empty stdout+stderr. `agentrunner.friendlyRunError` converts to a user-facing message sent via `input.SendOutput` on every run failure. Also handled softly during generation and design conversation turns.

### Guardrails

`internal/agentdesigner/guardrails.go`:
- `CheckEthics(code, "")` — blocklist (rm -rf, drop table, bitcoin wallet, etc.). Used on AGENT.md.
- `RunFullGuardrails(code, "")` — ethics + AST. Used on `tools/*.py`. AST blocks: `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `__import__`, `os.system`, `subprocess.*`, `socket.socket`.
- Composio: blocks SDK imports, hardcoded keys, wrong host, v1/v2 endpoints.

### Per-user coder isolation

- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` → `<data_dir>/claude-homes/<userID>/.claude/`
- `HOME` → `<data_dir>/claude-homes/<userID>/`
- `--setting-sources ""` — suppresses `settings.json` and all `CLAUDE.md` traversal.
- `.credentials.json` copied from operator's `~/.claude/` on every invocation.

**`ANTHROPIC_CONFIG_DIR` does NOT work** — only `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` redirects config.

### Coder filesystem confinement (Landlock)

`internal/sandbox` adds preventive filesystem confinement via Linux Landlock LSM. No external deps, no setuid, no namespaces.

**Mechanism:** `coder.buildCommand()` wraps the real command as `simple-agents __sandbox-exec <base64-spec>`. The helper applies `landlock.V5.BestEffort().RestrictPaths(...)` then `syscall.Exec`s the real command. Inherited by all children (`claude`→`bash`→`python`).

**Allowed:** RW: per-user HOME + agent workdir. RO: system paths, coder binary dir, user's vault root. Denied: SQLite DB, config.yaml, other users' vaults.

`config.SandboxConfig.Enabled` (default true; `SA_SANDBOX=0` disables). With Landlock unavailable, the sandbox is not applied and nothing physically prevents writes outside the vault — agents/chat run trusted within the user's own vault.

### Database

SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (CGo-free). WAL mode + foreign keys set on open. Migrations in alphabetical order from `migrations/`.

Schema tables: `users`, `platform_connections`, `platform_identities`, `agents`, `agent_schedules`, `agent_runs`, `secrets`, `chats`, `reminders`, `user_permissions`, `mcp_servers`, `settings`, `audit_logs`, `schema_migrations`, `chat_messages` (FK `chat_id`→`chats`), `coders`, `skills`, `agent_skills`.

```

### Admin vs. user separation

- **Admin** (`role="admin"`): only `/admin/*` — manages users, coder profiles, settings, audit.
- **Regular users**: only `/dashboard/*` — agents, secrets, connectors, chats, reminders, KB.
- `requireUserOnly` on `/dashboard/*` redirects admins to `/admin`.
- `requireAdmin` on `/admin/*` rejects non-admins with 403.

### Multi-coder system

Admin creates **Coder Profiles** (`coders` table) with `claude_bin`, `timeout_s`, `backend_type`. Users assigned via `users.coder_id` FK. `coderForUser(userID)` builds the right `*coder.Coder`, falling back to system defaults when unassigned.

### Natural language reminders

`internal/reminder/timeparser.go` — `ParseNaturalTime(text, now, loc)` parses expressions like `"in 10 minutes"`, `"tomorrow at 3pm"`, `"next Tuesday at noon"`. Both web UI and Telegram use `profile.LoadLocation(db, userID)` so reminders fire in the user's timezone.

---

## Known gaps

- No integration or e2e test coverage — unit tests cover logic boundaries; coder subprocess round-trips (real edit → test → approve) are exercised manually.
- **Discord adapter** — not implemented.
- **`/remind` list/delete via Telegram** — only create is wired.
- **MCP servers** — `mcp_servers` table exists; MCP tool execution not implemented.
